# Loan-Status-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the status of loan applications using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various features of loan applicants, the model predicts whether a loan will be approved or not.

Loan status prediction is a crucial task in the banking and finance industry. By predicting the likelihood of loan approval, financial institutions can better manage risks and make informed decisions. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for loan status classification.
